## Still not happy!

```js
function* fileExtractor() {
  const bauer = yield call(getFile, 'bauer');
  yield call(printFile, bauer);
  const chloe = yield call(getFile, 'chloe');
  yield call(printFile, chloe);
}
```

note:

What if I do not want to wait for bauer's file to get chloe's
I need a way to notify the run function that I want to run a series of actions in a non-blocking way
Let's call that a fork
